Project Objective :
 > The project involved analyzing customer behavior on the Zomato platform, which is a food delivery app.
 > The data used for the analysis was about Zomato sales based on membership, 
   which contained information about sales, customers, products, and membership.
 
Provided Task :
 > The task was to use SQL queries to answer several questions about customer behavior on Zomato. 
 > The sample questions included: 
   -- What is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato?
   -- How many days has each customer visited Zomato? 
   -- What was the first product purchased by each customer?
   -- What is the most purchased item on the menu
   -- Which item was most popular for each customer?
   -- Which item was purchased first by a customer after they became a member? etc

Project Approach :
 > Cleaned the data to ensure that it was in a usable format (datatypes). 
 > Checked any missing values and dealt with any data quality issues. 
 > Then used SQL queries to extract the data from the Zomato dataset and performed aggregate calculations on
   the data to answer the questions.

Analysis Report :
 > The result of this analysis showed that the most popular products on Zomato were product 1 and product 3. 
 > Based on the customer membership, users 1 and 2 earned the most Zomato points, and in the case of products,
   the highest points earned was for product 3 which is 3045 points. 
 > These insights helped in understanding customer behavior on Zomato App and will be useful for making informed decisions.
